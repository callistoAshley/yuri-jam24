they wake up and leave their room
the player finds out that they have to travel to a different angel to investigate a strange signal
serenity gets an item
they leave their own angel and a panorama graphic of the desolate landscape is shown as "godscape" plays
they travel to the angel on willow's motorcycle. this could be a good spot for a short characterization scene
they arrive at the angel and start exploring. literally anything that the level design demands could happen here. this is the Game part of the Game. it's completely fine for everything up to this point to feel slow, i think. 
whatever happens here in terms of story beats, i think it needs to mentally tear serenity apart. i was thinking of having her say something to willow that she didn't really *mean* to upset her, but it really really did. something like this would lead to them splitting ways and serenity having to explore on her own.
they discover that the angel is barely alive, and has been on the brink of death for a very long time. the signal they were tasked to investigate was fueled by intense emotion. they're drawn deeper into its body where the mechanical innards become more grotesque and flesh-like, ultimately culminating in a personal confrontation with the angel. 

...Is the sun setting already?
It always goes down so early this time of year... mmngh...
And your bed... it's too cosy and soft and warm...
...
OK.(pause) This is it, Serenity.
All you have to do(pause) is JUMP out of bed.
Muster all the energy you can and hit that JUMP button. You can do this.

an inciting event to force them deeper into the angel's body. 
* serenity accidentally says something fucked up to willow?
* the signal gets stronger in the deeper reaches of its body?
* an ominous glow?
* a hole opens in the ground?
* the signal embedding itself in serenity's head, calling her deeper as it rings in her brain?

- Serenity and Willow met on the Internet years ago through a brief communal creative project. They began to bond over anime n shit.
- Willow helped Serenity move out of her unpleasant family situation and into her angel. Serenity later began transitioning.
- Just before the events of the story (2ish weeks), Serenity's hormones were delayed. She has a panic attack, which she remarks about as the only one she's had in weeks.
- Willow is summoned to be part of a cyclic night brigade that inspects the outer skeleton of the angel for damage. Serenity offers to join, hoping it would help to clear her mind.
- GAME BEGIN
- possible intros: serenity gazing out a window, waking up in bed, .........
- Serenity and Willow have an argument, causing Serenity to panic and run away.
- some other Fucking things happen?????

serenity is heavily reliant on willow. a scene where she falls back onto willow to deal with a difficult situation 

Last night I dreamt the rashes on my hands turned into giant gaping wounds.
The blood on my left hand looked like it was boiling.
I ran them under the tap. The blood overflowed from the sink and crept up my ankles.
It didn't bother me.
