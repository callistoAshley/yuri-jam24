they wake up and leave their room
the player finds out that they have to travel to a different angel to investigate a strange signal
serenity gets an item
they leave their own angel and a panorama graphic of the desolate landscape is shown as "godscape" plays
they travel to the angel on willow's motorcycle. this could be a good spot for a short characterization scene
they arrive at the angel and start exploring. literally anything that the level design demands could happen here. this is the Game part of the Game. it's completely fine for everything up to this point to feel slow, i think. 
whatever happens here in terms of story beats, i think it needs to mentally tear serenity apart. i was thinking of having her say something to willow that she didn't really *mean* to upset her, but it really really did. something like this would lead to them splitting ways and serenity having to explore on her own.
they discover that the angel is barely alive, and has been on the brink of death for a very long time. the signal they were tasked to investigate was fueled by intense emotion. they're drawn deeper into its body where the mechanical innards become more grotesque and flesh-like, ultimately culminating in a personal confrontation with the angel. 

...Is the sun setting already?
It always goes down so early this time of year... mmngh...
And your bed... it's too cosy and soft and warm...
...
OK.(pause) This is it, Serenity.
All you have to do(pause) is JUMP out of bed.
Muster all the energy you can and hit that JUMP button. You can do this.

an inciting event to force them deeper into the angel's body. 
* serenity accidentally says something fucked up to willow?
* the signal gets stronger in the deeper reaches of its body?
* an ominous glow?
* a hole opens in the ground?
* the signal embedding itself in serenity's head, calling her deeper as it rings in her brain?
