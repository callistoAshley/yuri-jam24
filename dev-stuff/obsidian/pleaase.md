Willow finds Serenity asleep in their room. She wakes her up and reminds her that she needs to be present for an "orientation." When Serenity is stubborn about getting up, Willow picks her up and brings her arm over her shoulder. A brief exchange occurs here where the characters are further established.

They travel to the upper reaches of the angel where they meet someone who tells them about their mission: a simple repair job on the inner neck of the angel. As the "civilisation" proper lives in the lower body of the angel, there is no inside path to the head, so they need to travel by the outer body of the angel (i.e. outside)

Some basic item combination puzzles comprise the repair job itself. (melody i'm going to force you to play the bless you rip demo soon)

Willow leaves Serenity alone briefly and Serenity accidentally breaks a piece of her equipment. She gets upset, believing that Willow will hate her, and starts hyperventilating.
Willow tries to comfort Serenity when she comes back, but she only makes her feel worse.
Intuiting that Serenity is upset and nearby, the assumed-dead angel awakens. A gigantic cross appears where Serenity stands and absorbs her. Serenity's inventory is cleared.

Serenity awakens in a distorted form of her bedroom, and a very abstract, dreamlike sequence of events follows. The player's goal is to collect "dreams" - items whose descriptions depict dreams that Serenity has had - while exploring a realm formed by her mind melding with the angel's. 
As described by a lore-book shortly after the beginning of the game, "an angel's most important purpose is to intuit the needs of its people on a deep, individual level." When Serenity started having a breakdown inside the angel's head, its dying, unconscious hardware sensed that she was in danger and generated the "cross" that absorbed her. It follows that what happens in this section extensively describes Serenity as a character:
coming out as trans lead her parents to be very harsh on her. She met Willow on the Internet, and eventually moved in with her.

In the real-world, Serenity is unconscious on the floor, her body clearly in distress. In a panic, Willow runs to get help.

After Serenity collects every dream some shit happens. I need to iron this part out more. My current ideas are the angel directly confronting Serenity or Serenity beginning to feel like she "belongs" inside this dreamscape, free from the outside world.
Either way, Willow's pleas for her to wake up begin to break into her head. Serenity is confused, and starts begging her to leave. She talks about how being trans is a source of shame for her, and she doesn't think she could be loved. Willow cradles her face and comforts her, which sets her free.
