The sky has been a murky grey for weeks. Bright streaks of light are arcing up into the sky, meeting up at Artemis' halo. It smells awful outside.

I wish I could go out and weed the garden, but it hurts to breathe the air.
I wish I could speak to the people I love, but everyone is afraid to go out.
I wish I could feel soil and dirt under my feet.

I went to ask Artemis what was happening yesterday.
As I put my hand to her body, she was cold, still as a statue.
She wouldn't respond.
