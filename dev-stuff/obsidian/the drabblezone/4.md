"Hurry uuuuupppp, slowpoke!!"
I sleepily catch up to Willow. She flashes me a cheeky grin.
"Artemis doesn't have all night, you know."
"I'm sure she'd pardon my tardiness."
She rolls her eyes and grips the doorhandle. It responds with a long, pained creak, and a sigh that blows my hair into my mouth. I grip my bandana.
Dunes of red greet me as I step outside. The air is thick with the scent of burning metal, the aurorae barely breaking through the clouds. I turn around to see what's left of Artemis and her cables submerged in the glimmering sand.
