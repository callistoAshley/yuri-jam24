It's a long way between angels, and the best way to entertain yourself in the back of a moving van is to fidget with your tinny, dying laptop. The view outside isn't much to look at - the same old robotic carcasses amidst dunes and aurorae - but the warm glow of your computer screen lulls you into a trance. It's nice to be alone.
You jolt forward as the van stutters to a sudden stop, rescuing your laptop from an untimely demise. You've arrived... already.
As you buckle on your mask and step outside, the towering remains of an unnamed god greet you warmly.
