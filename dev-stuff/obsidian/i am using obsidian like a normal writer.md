Willow: "Hurry uuuuuuup, slowpoke! We don't have all night!"
(serenity walks up to willow slowly)
Serenity: "mmngh"
establishment of the goal and some affection in this scene

SERENITY: "Willow?"
	"Do you ever wonder what it would be like if... they were still here?"
WILLOW: "The angels?"
SERENITY: "Yeah."
	"It's like I can't get them out of my head lately. The idea of something all-powerful, all-knowing, just being... there. Alive."
	"I wish I could take that for granted."
WILLOW: "...Not really."
	"I mean, we weren't even *born* when they died. It's not like we have any real connection to them."
	"Aside from... living inside them."
	"And hey, look what we could salvage! It's a miracle we were even able to survive back then."
SERENITY: "Yeah... I guess you're right."
