Gigantic, intricate mechanical creatures, each created for one purpose: to protect humanity. The incomprehensibly vicious cosmic weather melts life under daylight. To remedy this, each angel bears a "halo": a sky-dwelling structure that creates a "safe zone" on the ground for cities to be built within.
Nobody really knows where the angels came from; as far as society knows, they've existed since the beginning of time.

"An angel's most important purpose is to intuit the needs of its people on a deep, individual level."
