Gigantic mechanical creatures that existed as long as history knew. They each bore a structure called a Halo, which emitted light and vital gases into the atmosphere. Standing on a halo is like being an ant crawling through a thick carpet.

maybe they didn't exactly concern themselves with human affairs but humans knew they were alive

the angels were protecting humanity from something and people lived in large colonies
the entity they were being protected from was the sun?
halos emitted a kind of cloud that protected people from the sun
