it's set in a post-apocalyptic world where the mechanical god-like entities that used to govern humanity have all died, making the outside world uninhabitable
the remaining shreds of humanity take refuge inside of the gods' corpses, and you play as a couple of scavengers exploring the newly fallen husk of a god for resources

you get stuck as a cat after fucking around with some potions and need to figure out how to transform back
and also you live with your friend and there's a friends to lovers subplot

Talking about dead satellites earlier gave me a story idea
You're some kind of satellite, sent out to explore space. Unfortunately, you run off of RTGs, which slowly produce less and less power, and now they're not enough to communicate with home
And then another satellite, also in your situation, gets in range
No clue how to translate this into gameplay, just an idea atm
