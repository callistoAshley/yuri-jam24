it's set in a post-apocalyptic world where the mechanical god-like entities that used to govern humanity have all died, making the outside world uninhabitable the remaining shreds of humanity take refuge inside of the gods' corpses, and you play as a couple of scavengers exploring the newly fallen husk of a god for resources

the scavengers discover the god isn't exactly quite dead yet, but barely gripping onto life
