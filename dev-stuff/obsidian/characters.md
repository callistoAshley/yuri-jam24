**Serenity** (she/her)
Artistic and reserved, she prefers taking things slow and appreciating the scenery.
She has a particular passion for preserving what would otherwise be lost - in particular, media preservation.

Being a trans woman is a source of shame for her. She views her transness as making her fundamentally "less" -  like she's a man wearing a woman's skin, and she's not worth getting close to.

For Luna: make her a bit scraggly, messy hair

other little details:
* she just moved in with her girlfriend, willow
* she has a little plant in her room :)
* her hormones were delayed just before the events of the game
* the last time she'd been outside was when she was a toddler

**Willow** (she/her)
A bouncy and energetic engineer with a natural inclination to learn. She loves to help others in any way she can.
Her ambitious hacking projects keep her busy... but maybe a little *too* busy. She struggles to balance self-maintenance and work, often getting lost in a project for weeks.

They both have casual-ish clothes; the specifics of what that means are up to you, but I don't imagine them prancing around in a ball dress or anything especially sci-fi.

In the events of the game, they are part of a rotating night brigade who go out to check for damage and gather resources from outside
