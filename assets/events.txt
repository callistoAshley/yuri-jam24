WILLOW: Ren!!
WILLOW: Reeen~~~~!! Come on, sleepyhead!
Someone's tugging at your arm.
...Has the sun set already? \.Ugh... \.it always goes down so early this time of year.
You pry your eyes open to a squint and acclimatize to the light.
Willow is giving you a displeased look.
WILLOW: You can't just sleep all night, you know. We have a job to do!
Oh. She must mean the night squad.
You moan and roll over.
SERENITY: Mmm... it can wait for my beauty sleep.
WILLOW: ...
AH!\. You feel yourself being pulled out of bed.
And... an arm wrapping around your body.
